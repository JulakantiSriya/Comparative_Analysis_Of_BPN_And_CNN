Conducted a comparative study on Back Propagation Network (BPN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks. 
Implemented both models from scratch using Python, without relying on any inbuilt machine learning libraries.
To run this project:
1. Download the reporitory 
2. And run it in Google collab or Jupiter or Anaconda.
You are all set to go!!!!
